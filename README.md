CamScanner-In-Python


The script takes an image as input and then scans the document from the image by applying few image processing techniques and gives the output image with scanned effect


Initially we need to resize the images so OpenCV can handle it 

Output includes:
Original, Grayscale, Threshold, Contours, warp perspective and final output in adaptive threshold
